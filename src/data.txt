She lived there for a full year before going back to free her friends and family and other slaves from other farms all the while putting herself in danger of getting caught and being sent back to work again. The actors in this movie did an amazing job at portraying the life style back then. Cynthia Erivo was incredibly brave to jump off the bridge into the rushing waters beneath. a man who recorded every slave who went through Philadelphia, to get her name recorded, to tell her story and to give herself a new name now that she was free.
